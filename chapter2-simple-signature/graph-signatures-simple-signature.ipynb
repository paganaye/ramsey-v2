This numerically confirms what we observed with Examples 1, 2, and 3: several non-isomorphic graphs must necessarily share the same signature, because there are more graphs than unique signatures our method can produce. This is the numerical sketch of proof that our v1 signature isn't sufficient to distinguish all graphs.\n"
