    "\n",
    "In Chapter 1 we devised a signature for a graph and saw that it works fine with a graph up to order 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that **Signature v1** was too simplistic to handle the complexity of graphs beyond order 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we are going to write an algorithm that aim at higher orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next step, Signature v2, builds directly on what we learned from Signature v1, which was too simplistic to handle the complexity of graphs beyond order 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this new algorithm is to generate a deterministic and unique signature for each node within a graph. This signature, reflecting the node's topological role, is invaluable for tasks like graph isomorphism testing or identifying structurally equivalent nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, the process is iterative. It starts with a simple characterization of each node (its number of neighbours) and recursively refines the signatures of ambiguous nodes until all possible distinctions have been made, giving us a much richer picture of the local connections around each node."

    "2.  Sort the entire list of signatures using the `Core Sorting Logic`.\n",
    "3.  Scan the sorted list. Any signature that is unique is considered unambiguous. Assign it a ***finalIndex*** (its current position in the array) and a ***resolutionStep*** (which is 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5.2 Main Loop (Subsequent Passes)\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Cycle Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "During the recursive expansion of a signature (e.g., E -> F -> ...), the algorithm must track the current expansion path. If it attempts to expand a neighbour that is already an ancestor in this path (e.g., expanding F's neighbours and re-encountering E), a cycle is detected.\n",

    "## 3.7 Interpreting the Signature Results\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.7.1 What the Signatures Reveal\n",
    "This final array is the canonical \"fingerprint\" of the graph's topology.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Structural Equivalence (Symmetry)\n",
    "\n",
    "The most significant conclusion is that **nodes E and F have perfectly identical signatures.** This means the algorithm has proven that from a topological standpoint, nodes E and F are indistinguishable and occupy symmetrical, interchangeable positions in the graph. They belong to the same \"orbit\" of the graph's automorphism group.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unique Structural Roles\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm successfully assigned a unique signature and ***finalIndex*** to four of the six nodes: **A, B, C, and D**. This demonstrates that these four nodes each have a distinct structural role within the graph that can be differentiated by their connectivity patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Hierarchy of Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The ***resolutionStep*** value in each signature reveals how \"difficult\" it was for the algorithm to resolve each node's role, creating a structural hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simplest Roles (`resolutionStep: 1`):** Nodes **B, A, and C** were identified immediately, defined purely by their number of neighbours.\n",
    "* **Intermediate Role (`resolutionStep: 2`):** Node **D** required looking at its immediate neighbours to be resolved.\n",
    "* **Most Complex Roles (`resolutionStep: 3`):** Nodes **E and F** are the most complex, defined by a recursive, cyclical relationship that required a 3-pass analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.7.2 Toward a Canonical Graph Signature\n",
    "\n",
    "This final, sorted array of label-less signatures is a **canonical representation of the entire graph**. This output can be used for comparison; if another graph produces the exact same final array, the two graphs are **isomorphic** (structurally identical).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "While this algorithm produces a highly detailed and deterministic signature, it's important to acknowledge two significant trade-offs: its computational complexity and the potential size of the generated signatures.\n",
    "#### A Note on Empirical Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to state that the algorithm detailed here is a formal specification. While its logic was battle-tested and refined using our 6-node example, it has **not yet been implemented in code or benchmarked** against a wide variety of complex graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, its real-world performance characteristics, memory consumption, and correctness on edge cases are still theoretical. The logical next step would be a robust implementation to validate these results empirically and confirm its practical effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Computational Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of this algorithm is not its primary strength. The complexity can be considerable, especially for large or densely connected graphs. The main drivers of this complexity are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sorting in Each Pass:** The need to re-sort the entire list of node signatures after each expansion pass is computationally intensive.\n",
    "2.  **Recursive Comparison:** The core comparison logic, which may involve deep, lexicographical comparisons of nested ***neighbours*** arrays, can be costly for nodes in complex regions of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is therefore better suited for offline, in-depth structural analysis where descriptive accuracy is paramount, rather than for high-performance or real-time applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Signature Size\n",
    "\n",
    "The canonical signatures themselves, while rich in information, can become very large and deeply nested. This is because the signature of a node effectively encodes the structure of its surrounding neighbourhood, potentially to a great depth, to resolve ambiguities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, the storage requirements for the final set of signatures for a large graph can be substantial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, this algorithm trades performance and conciseness for an extremely high degree of structural detail and accuracy."
