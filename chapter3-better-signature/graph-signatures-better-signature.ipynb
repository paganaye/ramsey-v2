    "## Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm operates on two main data structures: the `Node Signature` for each node in the graph, and simple `Neighbor Representation` objects used during the expansion process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Node Signature\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the primary object representing a node during computation. A signature is considered **`COLLAPSED`** initially. It becomes **`EXPANDED`** when its `neighbors` array is populated. It is **`FINALIZED`** once it is assigned a `finalIndex`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Node Signature` has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`label`**: `string` - The node's unique identifier (e.g., 'A'). Used for tracking.\n",
    "* **`neighborCount`**: `number` - The degree of the node. This is the primary sorting criterion.\n",
    "* **`finalIndex`**: `number` (optional) - The node's unique, zero-based rank in the sorted list. A signature is considered `FINALIZED` once this is assigned.\n",
    "* **`finishStep`**: `number` (optional) - The pass number in which the `finalIndex` was assigned.\n",
    "* **`neighbors`**: `array` (optional) - If a signature is ambiguous, this array is populated with `Neighbor Representation` objects to resolve the ambiguity.\n",
    "* **cycleDistance**: number (optional) - A marker used to describe a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neighbor Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "When a `Node Signature` is expanded, its `neighbors` array is populated with node signatures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **For a finalized neighbor**: `{ finalIndex: number }`\n",
    "    * A reference to a neighbor that is already unambiguous.\n",
    "* **For a non-finalized neighbor**: `{ neighborCount: number }`\n",
    "    * A reference to a neighbor that is still ambiguous.\n",
    "* **For a cycle**: `{ cycleDistance: number }`\n",
    "    * A marker used to terminate a recursive expansion when it loops back to an ancestor in the current expansion path. `cycleDistance` is the number of steps back to the first occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Sorting Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison between any two signatures, `sigA` and `sigB`, follows a strict hierarchy of rules. This ensures a stable and deterministic order, meaning the relative order of two unequal signatures will never change in subsequent passes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison rules are applied in this exact order:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. By `neighborCount` (descending)**\n",
    "* The signature with the higher `neighborCount` always comes first.\n",
    "* If `neighborCount` values are different, the comparison stops here.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. By `finalIndex` (ascending)**\n",
    "* *This rule is applied only if `neighborCount` is identical.*\n",
    "* A signature that has a `finalIndex` comes before one that does not.\n",
    "* If both have a `finalIndex`, the one with the lower value comes first.\n",
    "* If `finalIndex` values are also identical (for inter-graph comparison), sort by `finishStep` (ascending).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. By `cycleDistance` (ascending)**\n",
    "* *This rule is applied only if the signatures are still tied (same `neighborCount`, neither has a `finalIndex`).*\n",
    "* A signature with a `cycleDistance` comes before one that does not.\n",
    "* If both have a `cycleDistance`, the one with the lower value comes first.\n",
    "* If cycleDistance values are also identical, sort by finishStep (ascending).\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. By `neighbors` array (recursive)**\n",
    "* *This rule is applied only if the signatures are still tied.*\n",
    "* If one signature is `EXPANDED` (has a `neighbors` array) and the other is `COLLAPSED` (does not), the `EXPANDED` one comes first.\n",
    "* If both are `EXPANDED`, sort by recursively comparing their `neighbors` arrays.\n",
    "* If both are `COLLAPSED` (i.e., not yet expanded in the current pass), they are considered **equal for now**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm proceeds in passes, attempting to finalize signatures at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  For each node in the graph, create a `Node Signature` object in the `COLLAPSED` state, populating its `label` and `neighborCount`.\n",
    "2.  Sort the entire list of signatures using the `Core Sorting Logic`.\n",
    "3.  Scan the sorted list. Any signature that is unique is considered unambiguous. Assign it a `finalIndex` (its current position in the array) and a `finishStep` (which is 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Loop (Subsequent Passes)\n",
    "\n",
    "If, after a pass, there are still ambiguous signatures (those without a `finalIndex`), a new pass is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  For each ambiguous `Node Signature`, we expand it by populating its `neighbors` array.\n",
    "2.  For each neighbor of the corresponding node in the graph, we create a `Neighbor Representation` and add it to the array:\n",
    "    * If the neighbor's signature is already `FINALIZED`, add a `{ finalIndex: ... }` representation.\n",
    "    * If the neighbor's signature is not finalized, add a `{ neighborCount: ... }` representation.\n",
    "3.  Once populated, each new `neighbors` array is sorted using the same `Core Sorting Logic`.\n",
    "4.  After all ambiguous signatures are expanded, the entire list is re-sorted globally.\n",
    "5.  The algorithm then attempts to assign a `finalIndex` and `finishStep` to any signature that has now become unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cycle Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "During the recursive expansion of a signature (e.g., E -> F -> ...), the algorithm must track the current expansion path. If it attempts to expand a neighbor that is already an ancestor in this path (e.g., expanding F's neighbors and re-encountering E), a cycle is detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The expansion of that branch is terminated.\n",
    "* The neighbor is represented with a `{ cycleDistance: number }` object, marking the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Termination\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm terminates when either:\n",
    "* All signatures have been assigned a `finalIndex`.\n",
    "* A full pass completes with no new signatures being finalized. This occurs when remaining ambiguities are due to perfect structural symmetry, which the algorithm has correctly identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Signature Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the algorithm terminates, the list of `Node Signature` objects can be converted into a cleaner, final format for output. This typically involves removing working properties like `label` to leave a purely structural, canonical signature."

    "# Interpreting the Signature Results\n",
    "\n",
    "## What the Signatures Reveal\n",
    "This final array is the canonical \"fingerprint\" of the graph's topology.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Structural Equivalence (Symmetry)\n",
    "\n",
    "The most significant conclusion is that **nodes E and F have perfectly identical signatures.** This means the algorithm has proven that from a topological standpoint, nodes E and F are indistinguishable and occupy symmetrical, interchangeable positions in the graph. They belong to the same \"orbit\" of the graph's automorphism group.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Unique Structural Roles\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm successfully assigned a unique signature and `finalIndex` to four of the six nodes: **A, B, C, and D**. This demonstrates that these four nodes each have a distinct structural role within the graph that can be differentiated by their connectivity patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. A Hierarchy of Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The `finishStep` value in each signature reveals how \"difficult\" it was for the algorithm to resolve each node's role, creating a structural hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simplest Roles (`finishStep: 1`):** Nodes **B, A, and C** were identified immediately, defined purely by their number of neighbors.\n",
    "* **Intermediate Role (`finishStep: 2`):** Node **D** required looking at its immediate neighbors to be resolved.\n",
    "* **Most Complex Roles (`finishStep: 3`):** Nodes **E and F** are the most complex, defined by a recursive, cyclical relationship that required a 3-pass analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. A Canonical Graph Signature\n",
    "\n",
    "This final, sorted array of label-less signatures is a **canonical representation of the entire graph**. This output can be used for comparison; if another graph produces the exact same final array, the two graphs are **isomorphic** (structurally identical).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "While this algorithm produces a highly detailed and deterministic signature, it's important to acknowledge two significant trade-offs: its computational complexity and the potential size of the generated signatures.\n",
    "### A Note on Empirical Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to state that the algorithm detailed here is a formal specification. While its logic was battle-tested and refined using our 6-node example, it has **not yet been implemented in code or benchmarked** against a wide variety of complex graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, its real-world performance characteristics, memory consumption, and correctness on edge cases are still theoretical. The logical next step would be a robust implementation to validate these results empirically and confirm its practical effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computational Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of this algorithm is not its primary strength. The complexity can be considerable, especially for large or densely connected graphs. The main drivers of this complexity are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sorting in Each Pass:** The need to re-sort the entire list of node signatures after each expansion pass is computationally intensive.\n",
    "2.  **Recursive Comparison:** The core comparison logic, which may involve deep, lexicographical comparisons of nested `neighbors` arrays, can be costly for nodes in complex regions of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is therefore better suited for offline, in-depth structural analysis where descriptive accuracy is paramount, rather than for high-performance or real-time applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Signature Size\n",
    "\n",
    "The canonical signatures themselves, while rich in information, can become very large and deeply nested. This is because the signature of a node effectively encodes the structure of its surrounding neighborhood, potentially to a great depth, to resolve ambiguities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, the storage requirements for the final set of signatures for a large graph can be substantial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, this algorithm trades performance and conciseness for an extremely high degree of structural detail and accuracy."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the blueprint of the algorithm is complete, the ultimate question remains: does this theoretical power survive the harsh realities of implementation?\n",
    "Signature v1 was an 'order 3' algorithm. Now, with a recursive engine built to handle arbitrary depth, we must embark on the next phase to measure the true, and perhaps unlimited, order of our Signature V2."
